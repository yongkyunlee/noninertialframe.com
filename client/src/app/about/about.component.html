        <h2>Why Noninertial Frame?</h2>
        <p>
            Noninertial frame, by definition, is a frame of reference that moves with the object, 
            so that the moving object appears to violate Newton's laws of motion since it accelerates despite having no horizontal forces on it (Dictionary.com).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is a frame whose velocity is continuously changing and in which classical laws of mechanics do not work.
            It is also the real frame we live or should live in because our world moves every moment.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Noninertial Frame</strong> is to keep ourselves in a frame that accelerates every moment. 
            Acceleration does not necessarily refer to increase of speed; it could be change of direction or even decrease of speed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every moment, we change the speed or direction, eventually towards the dream each one of us has. 
            The posts in this blog will mainly deal with my projects and display the trace of the professional side of my life.
